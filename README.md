This is simple project. (for beginner)
written in ' C ' by me without any graphic library.
For those people who want to make project and they Only know to create application in console ;)
It helps people to improve him/her creativity in console application.

Run in terminal " make "  //see directory are same( where file is located ) other wise won't compile
and then run ./RunMe (for see output)

On windows
